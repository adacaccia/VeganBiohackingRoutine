### Vegan Biohacking Routine – English Voice-Over

---

## 🎧 General pacing
- Speak **slowly, ~115–120 words per minute.**  
- Short pause (0.5 s) at the end of each sentence.  
- Slightly longer pause (1 s) at transitions or overlays.  
- Keep your tone **neutral and reflective**, not enthusiastic.  
- Smile lightly while speaking — it softens vowels naturally.

## 🧠 Tone & emphasis suggestions

### Segment 1 – Intro
> “Hi everyone, I’m Adalberto — I’m 53 years old,  
> and in the last six months I’ve lost 14 kilos.”

- Emphasize **“lost 14 kilos”** with a soft downward tone (no pride).  
- Pause after “53 years old”.  
- Keep voice low and sincere.

---

### Segment 2 – Cronometer
> “I use Cronometer dot com to track everything I eat.”

- “dot com” — say softly, almost as a parenthesis.  
- Emphasize **“everything I eat.”**  
- When listing nutrients, slow slightly:  
  > “Proteins, carbs, fats… that’s just the beginning.”

---

### Segment 3 – Practical part
> “What you’ll see isn’t a recipe — it’s a routine.”

- Emphasize *routine* with downward tone.  
- Add a slight smile when saying:  
  > “The same simple act, repeated every morning.”

---

### Segment 4 – Outro
> “Every day starts here.  
> A breakfast that’s simple, nourishing, measured —  
> but most of all, conscious.”

- Drop tone gently on *conscious.*  
- Pause before *“Nulla dies sine linea — not even in the morning.”*  
- For the Latin, lower volume and speak more slowly (about half pace).

## 🎚️ Recording tips
- Use **cardioid mic** 20–25 cm distance.  
- Gain around 35 %, target −12 dB peaks.  
- Record 3 takes:
  1. *Neutral take* — straight, clean  
  2. *Soft take* — slower, introspective  
  3. *Warm take* — slightly more friendly  
- Choose the one that sounds most “you” when played over the video.

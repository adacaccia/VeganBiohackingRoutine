### Vegan Biohacking Routine · From measurement to awareness

## 🎧 Intro (spoken part)

> “Hi everyone, I’m Adalberto — I’m 53 years old,  
> and in the last six months I’ve lost 14 kilos.  
>  
> Even though I’ve been vegan for sixteen years,  
> during the pandemic I still gained weight —  
> and for a long time, I couldn’t get rid of it… until now.  
>  
> I’m not here to tell random stories.  
> Everything starts from personal experience, yes,  
> but every claim I make will be backed by science —  
> and, more importantly, by methods that anyone can replicate.”

## 🧮 Cronometer – data awareness

> “I use Cronometer.com to track everything I eat.  
> It’s not the easiest tool — everything is in English —  
> but it gives me something most people never see:  
> a full analysis of what’s inside my food.  
>  
> Proteins, carbs, fats… that’s just the beginning.  
> Scroll further down and you’ll find  
> all essential amino acids, all vitamins, all minerals.  
>  
> And here — look at these synthetic indicators:  
> 100 % nutrition target, 100 % immune support,  
> 100 % antioxidants.  
> Nothing missing. No miracle — just method.”

## 🥣 Practical section – the breakfast routine

> “Now, let’s move to the practical part: my functional breakfast.  
>  
> What you’ll see isn’t a recipe — it’s a routine.  
> The same simple act, repeated every morning,  
> with small seasonal variations.  
>  
> The goal isn’t perfection, it’s stability:  
> a breakfast that balances energy, fiber, and calm.”

## 🎤 Outro (to record)

> “Every day starts here.  
> A breakfast that’s simple, nourishing, measured —  
> but most of all, conscious.  
>  
> *Nulla dies sine linea* — not even in the morning.”

# EP01 – Functional Vegan Breakfast (Spoken English Script – v4)

This is my functional vegan breakfast.  
It’s not about trends. It’s about **stability, simplicity, and nutrient integrity** — all for less than one euro.

Here’s how I prepare it — every morning, in the same precise order:

First, I weigh **18 grams of raw walnuts**.  
Then, **32 grams of vegan protein powder** — pea and soy blend.  
And finally, **180 grams of rolled oats**.

I mix these dry ingredients together — **before adding any liquid**.  
This prevents clumping and ensures even hydration.

Now, I prepare the liquids.  
I brew **250 grams of green tea**, then let it cool to **45 degrees Celsius**.  
I also warm **220 grams of water** to the same temperature — **45°C**.

Why?  
Because higher temperatures can denature sensitive compounds in the protein and oats.  
At 45°C, everything stays stable — but the meal feels warm, especially in winter.

I pour both liquids into the dry mix — total weight: **700 grams**.  
I stir **once**, just to combine.  
Then, I wait **five minutes**. No more stirring. The oats hydrate fully on their own.

The result? A smooth, cohesive porridge — rich in beta-glucans, iron, magnesium, B vitamins, plant-based omega-3s, and complete protein.

Total cost? **One euro and nine cents**.  
Nutrient coverage? **10% of my daily essential micronutrients** — tracked in Cronometer.

This meal gives me **stable energy**, **no blood sugar spikes**, and **mental clarity** until lunch.

It’s simple.  
But every detail — from sequence to temperature — has a reason.

And in this project, **reason is the recipe**.

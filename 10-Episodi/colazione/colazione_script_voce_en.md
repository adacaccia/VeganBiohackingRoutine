# EP01 – Functional Vegan Breakfast (Spoken English Script – v5)

This is my functional vegan breakfast.  
It’s not about trends. It’s about **stability, simplicity, and nutrient density** — all for **less than one euro**.

Here’s how I prepare it — every morning, in the same precise order:

First, I weigh **18 grams of raw walnuts**.  
Then, **32 grams of vegan protein powder** — pea and soy blend.  
And finally, **180 grams of rolled oats**.

I mix these dry ingredients together — **before adding any liquid**.  
This prevents clumping and ensures even hydration.

Now, I add **470 grams of water**, warmed to **45 degrees Celsius**.  
Why 45°C? Because it’s warm enough to feel comforting in winter, but cool enough to preserve sensitive compounds in the protein and oats.

I pour the water into the dry mix — total weight: **700 grams**.  
I stir **once**, just to combine.  
Then, I wait **five minutes**. No more stirring. The oats hydrate fully on their own.

The result? A smooth, cohesive porridge — rich in beta-glucans, iron, magnesium, B vitamins, plant-based omega-3s, and complete protein.

Total cost? **Ninety-nine cents**.  
Nutrient coverage? **10% of my daily essential micronutrients** — tracked in Cronometer.

This meal gives me **stable energy**, **no blood sugar spikes**, and **mental clarity** until lunch.

It’s simple.  
But every detail — from sequence to temperature — has a reason.

And in this project, **reason is the recipe**.

### Vegan Biohacking Routine – International Voice Track

---

## 🎙️ Pre-recording setup

- [ ] **Microphone:** cardioid condenser or lavalier  
- [ ] **Distance:** 20–25 cm from mouth  
- [ ] **Pop filter:** mandatory  
- [ ] **Environment:** curtains closed, fridge / vents off, no echo  
- [ ] **Gain:** set so peaks reach −6 dB, average −12 dB  
- [ ] **Sampling:** 48 kHz / 24-bit mono  
- [ ] **File name:** `EP01_breakfast_voice_EN_take1.wav`

---

## 🗣️ Voice delivery

- [ ] Speak slowly (**115–120 wpm**)  
- [ ] Pause ~0.5 s between sentences  
- [ ] Smile slightly — improves tone warmth  
- [ ] Keep accent neutral: international / light Italian ok  
- [ ] Maintain low volume consistency (avoid jumps)  
- [ ] Emphasize key words: *“functional”*, *“awareness”*, *“routine”*  
- [ ] Avoid Italian rhythm on English multisyllables (no “melody”)  
- [ ] Latin phrase: **“Nulla dies sine linea”** → speak half speed, softer voice  

---

## 🎧 Recording session

- [ ] Record **3 takes**:  
  - A — Neutral tone (base)  
  - B — Warm tone (slower, reflective)  
  - C — Soft tone (minimal energy, more intimate)  
- [ ] Include **5 s silence** before take for noise profiling  
- [ ] Clap at start of each take for sync mark  
- [ ] Listen with closed-back headphones to monitor noise  

---

## 🪄 Post-processing

- [ ] Noise reduction (profile from silence section)  
- [ ] Light EQ: HPF 80 Hz / +2 dB @ 5 kHz  
- [ ] Compression ratio 3:1, makeup +2 dB  
- [ ] Normalization target −14 LUFS (−1 dBTP)  
- [ ] Fade-in/out 300 ms  
- [ ] Export final: `EP01_breakfast_voice_EN_final.wav`

## 🧠 Notes

- Check pronunciation guide (`EP01-breakfast_pronunciation.md`) before recording.  
- Keep hydration (room-temperature water, not cold).  
- Avoid caffeine right before recording — tightens articulation.  
- Run a short **warm-up:** 30 s breathing + 10 tongue rolls.  
- Always record a “reference smile” tone first: it sets your emotional baseline.

🎙 EP01 – Functional Vegan Breakfast (Spoken English Script – v3, final)

    (Pause 1 sec)

This is my functional vegan breakfast.
It’s not about trends. It’s about stability, simplicity, and nutrient integrity — all for less than one euro.

Here’s how I prepare it — every morning, in the same precise order:

First, I weigh 18 grams of raw walnuts.
Then, 32 grams of vegan protein powder — pea and soy blend.
And finally, 180 grams of rolled oats.

I mix these dry ingredients together — before adding any liquid.
This prevents clumping and ensures even hydration.

Now, I prepare the liquids.
I brew 250 grams of green tea, then let it cool to 45 degrees Celsius.
I also warm 220 grams of water to the same temperature — 45°C.  

Why?
Because higher temperatures can denature sensitive compounds in the protein and oats.
At 45°C, everything stays stable — but the meal feels warm, especially in winter.

I pour both liquids into the dry mix — total weight: 700 grams.
I stir once, just to combine.
Then, I wait five minutes. No more stirring. The oats hydrate fully on their own.

The result? A smooth, cohesive porridge — rich in beta-glucans, iron, magnesium, B vitamins, plant-based omega-3s, and complete protein.

Total cost? 99 cents.
Nutrient coverage? 10% of my daily essential micronutrients — tracked in Cronometer.

This meal gives me stable energy, no blood sugar spikes, and mental clarity until lunch.

It’s simple.
But every detail — from sequence to temperature — has a reason.

And in this project, reason is the recipe.
